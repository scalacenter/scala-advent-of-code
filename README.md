## Website

The [Scala Advent of Code](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/) website contains:
- some explanation of our solutions to [Advent of Code (adventofcode.com)](https://adventofcode.com/)
- more solutions from the community

## Setup

We use Visual Studio Code with Metals to write Scala code, and scala-cli to compile and run it.

You can follow these [steps](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/setup) to set up your environement.

### How to open in Visual Studio Code

After you clone the repository, open a terminal and run:
```
$ cd scala-advent-of-code
$ scala-cli setup-ide 2023
$ mkdir 2023/input
$ code 2023
```

`code 2023` will open Visual Studio Code and start Metals. If not you may have to go to the Metals pane and click
the button labelled "Start Metals".

When you navigate to a file, e.g. `2023/src/day01.scala` metals should index the project, and then display code lenses
above each of the main methods `part1` and `part2`, as shown in this image:

To run a solution, first copy your input to the folder `2023/input`.
Then click `run` in VS Code which will run the code and display the results of the program. Or `debug`,
which will let you pause on breakpoints, and execute expressions in the debug console.

### How to run a solution with command line

In a terminal you can run:
```
$ scala-cli 2023 -M day01.part1
Compiling project (Scala 3.x.y, JVM)
Compiled project (Scala 3.x.y, JVM)
The solution is 64929
```

Or, to run another solution:
```
$ scala-cli 2023 -M <dayX>.<partX>
```

By default the solution programs run on our input files which are stored in the `2023/input` folder.
To get your solutions you can change the content of those files in the `2023/input` folder.
