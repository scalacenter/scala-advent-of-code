# Day 7: Camel Cards

## Part 1 Solution

The problem, in its essence, is a simplified version of the classic poker problem where you are required to compare poker hands according to certain rules.

### Domain

We'll start by defining the domain of the problem:

```scala
type Card = Char
type Hand = String
case class Bet(hand: Hand, bid: Int)
enum HandType:
  case HighCard, OnePair, TwoPair, ThreeOfAKind, FullHouse, FourOfAKind, FiveOfAKind
```

We can then define the constructors to create a `Bet` and a `HandType`:

```scala
object Bet:
  def apply(s: String): Bet = Bet(s.take(5), s.drop(6).toInt)

object HandType:
  def apply(hand: Hand): HandType =
    val cardCounts: List[Int] =
      hand.groupBy(identity).values.toList.map(_.length).sorted.reverse

    cardGroups match
      case 5 :: _ => HandType.FiveOfAKind
      case 4 :: _ => HandType.FourOfAKind
      case 3 :: 2 :: Nil => HandType.FullHouse
      case 3 :: _ => HandType.ThreeOfAKind
      case 2 :: 2 :: _ => HandType.TwoPair
      case 2 :: _ => HandType.OnePair
      case _ => HandType.HighCard
  end apply
```

A `Bet` is created from a `String` e.g. `"5678A 364"` - that is, the hand and the bid amount.

A `HandType` is a bit more complicated: it is calculated from `Hand` - e.g. `"5678A"` - according to the rules specified in the challenge. Since the essence of hand scoring lies in how many occurrences of a given card there are in the hand, we utilize Scala's declarative collection capabilities to group the cards and calculate their occurrences. We can then use a `match` expression to look for the occurrences patterns as specified in the challenge, in descending order of value.

### Comparison

The objective of the challenge is to sort bets and calculate the final winnings. Let's address the sorting part. Scala collections are good enough at sorting, so we don't need to implement the sorting proper. But for Scala to do its job, it needs to know the ordering function of the elements. We need to define how to compare two bets:

```scala
val ranks = "23456789TJQKA"
given cardOrdering: Ordering[Card] = Ordering.by(ranks.indexOf(_))
given handOrdering: Ordering[Hand] = (h1: Hand, h2: Hand) =>
  val h1Type = HandType(h1)
  val h2Type = HandType(h2)
  if h1Type != h2Type then h1Type.ordinal - h2Type.ordinal
  else h1.zip(h2).find(_ != _).map( (c1, c2) => cardOrdering.compare(c1, c2) ).getOrElse(0)
given betOrdering: Ordering[Bet] = Ordering.by(_.hand)
```

We define three orderings: one for cards, one for hands, and one for bets.

The card ordering is simple: we compare the cards according to their rank. The hand ordering is implemented according to the spec of the challenge: we first compare the hand types, and if they are equal, we compare the individual cards of the hands.

The bet ordering is then defined in terms of hand ordering.

### Calculating the winnings

Given the work we've done so far, calculating the winnings is a matter of sorting the bets and calculating the winnings for each:

```scala
def calculateWinnings(bets: List[Bet]): Int =
  bets.sorted.zipWithIndex.map { case (bet, index) => bet.bid * (index + 1) }.sum

def parse(input: String): List[Bet] =
  input.linesIterator.toList.map(Bet(_))

def part1(input: String): Int =
  calculateWinnings(parse(input))
```

We read the bets from the input string, sort them, and calculate the winnings for each bet.

## Part 2 Solution

The second part of the challenge changes the meaning of the `J` card. Now it's a Joker, which can be used as any card to produce the best hand possible. In practice, it means determining the prevailing card of the hand and becoming that card: such is the winning strategy of using the Joker. Another change in the rules is that now `J` is the weakest card when used in tiebreaking comparisons.

We can re-use most of the logic of the Part 1 solution. However because of the different set of rules, we need to create an abstraction to describe the rules for each part, then change the hand scoring logic to take the rules abstraction into account.

### Rules

We define a `Rules` trait that encapsulates the rules of the game and implement it for both cases:

```scala
trait Rules:
  val rankValues: String
  val wildcard: Option[Card]

val standardRules = new Rules:
  val rankValues = "23456789TJQKA"
  val wildcard = None

val jokerRules = new Rules:
  val rankValues = "J23456789TQKA"
  val wildcard = Some('J')
```

### Comparison

We then need to change the hand type estimation logic to take the rules into account:

```scala
object HandType:
  def apply(hand: Hand)(using rules: Rules): HandType =
    val cardCounts: Map[Card, Int] =
      hand.groupBy(identity).mapValues(_.length).toMap

    val cardGroups: List[Int] = rules.wildcard match
      case Some(card) if cardCounts.keySet.contains(card) =>
        val wildcardCount = cardCounts(card)
        val cardGroupsNoWildcard = cardCounts.removed(card).values.toList.sorted.reverse
        cardGroupsNoWildcard match
          case Nil => List(wildcardCount)
          case _ => cardGroupsNoWildcard.head + wildcardCount :: cardGroupsNoWildcard.tail
      case _ => cardCounts.values.toList.sorted.reverse

    cardGroups match
      case 5 :: _ => HandType.FiveOfAKind
      case 4 :: _ => HandType.FourOfAKind
      case 3 :: 2 :: Nil => HandType.FullHouse
      case 3 :: _ => HandType.ThreeOfAKind
      case 2 :: 2 :: _ => HandType.TwoPair
      case 2 :: _ => HandType.OnePair
      case _ => HandType.HighCard
  end apply
end HandType
```

The logic is the same as in the Part 1 solution, except that now we need to take the wildcard into account. If the wildcard is present in the hand, we need to calculate the hand type as if the wildcard was not present, and then add the wildcard count to the largest group of cards. If the wildcard is not present, we calculate the hand type as before. We also handle the case when the hand is composed entirely of wildcards.

We then need to change the card comparison logic to also depend on the rules:

```scala
given cardOrdering(using rules: Rules): Ordering[Card] = Ordering.by(rules.rankValues.indexOf(_))
```

The rest of the orderings stay the same, except we need to make them also depend on the `Rules` as they all use `cardOrdering` in some way:

```scala
given handOrdering(using Rules): Ordering[Hand] = (h1: Hand, h2: Hand) =>
  val h1Type = HandType(h1)
  val h2Type = HandType(h2)
  if h1Type != h2Type then h1Type.ordinal - h2Type.ordinal
  else h1.zip(h2).find(_ != _).map( (c1, c2) => cardOrdering.compare(c1, c2) ).getOrElse(0)
given betOrdering(using Rules): Ordering[Bet] = Ordering.by(_.hand)
```

### Calculating the winnings

The winnings calculation also stays the same, except for the addition of the `Rules` parameter, which is required for sorting the bets.
```scala
def calculateWinnings(bets: List[Bet])(using Rules): Int =
  bets.sorted.zipWithIndex.map { case (bet, index) => bet.bid * (index + 1) }.sum
```

Finally, we can calculate the winnings as before while specifying the rules under which to do the calculation:

```scala
def part2(input: String): Int =
  calculateWinnings(parse(input))(using jokerRules)
```

def part1(input: String): Int =
  println(calculateWinnings(parse(input))(using standardRules))

def part2(input: String): Int =
  println(calculateWinnings(parse(input))(using jokerRules))
```
