## Modeling and parsing the input

The input is an image enhancement algorithm string, and an initial input image.

The image is a black and white rectangle. We model the pixels with an
enumeration:

~~~ scala
enum Pixel:
  case Lit, Dark
~~~

A pixel can either be lit, or dark.

In the input text, lit pixels are represented by the character "#", whereas
dark pixels are represented by the character "." (dot). We use pattern
matching to parse them:

~~~ scala
object Pixel:
  def parse(char: Char): Pixel =
    char match
      case '#' => Pixel.Lit
      case '.' => Pixel.Dark
end Pixel
~~~

In case the input is malformed (ie, it contains a character other than "#"
or "."), the method `parse` raises an exception.

The enhancement algorithm string is provided as a line of 512 pixels. We
parse it as follows:

~~~ scala
class Enhancer(enhancementString: IndexedSeq[Pixel])

object Enhancer:
  def parse(input: String): Enhancer =
    Enhancer(input.map(Pixel.parse))
end Enhancer
~~~

There is a subtlety regarding the input image to which we want to apply the
enhancement algorithm: its size is infinite. Initially, its pixels are all
dark except in the rectangle we are given as initial input. So, we model an
image as a two-dimensional indexed sequence, and the color of all the pixels
that are out of the bounds of that two-dimensional indexed sequence:

~~~ scala
class Image(pixels: IndexedSeq[IndexedSeq[Pixel]], outOfBoundsPixel: Pixel):
  require(pixels.map(_.length).distinct.size == 1, "All the rows must have the same length")

  val height = pixels.length
  val width  = pixels(0).length
~~~

Since there is no direct way to model two-dimensional collections in the
standard library, we model the table of pixels as a collection of rows,
where each row is a collection of pixels. We add the call to `require` to
make sure that all the lines have the same length.

We parse the input image by parsing every line of the provided rectangular
area, and by setting the color of the out-of-bounds pixels to `Dark`:

~~~ scala
object Image:
  def parse(input: String): Image =
    val pixels =
      input
        .linesIterator.map(line => line.map(Pixel.parse))
        .toIndexedSeq
    val outOfBoundsPixel = Pixel.Dark
    Image(pixels, outOfBoundsPixel)
end Image
~~~

Last, we parse both sections of the input with the following method:

~~~ scala
def parseEnhancerAndImage(input: String): (Enhancer, Image) =
  val enhancerAndImage = input.split("\n\n")
  val enhancer         = Enhancer.parse(enhancerAndImage(0))
  val image            = Image.parse(enhancerAndImage(1))
  (enhancer, image)
~~~

## Image enhancement algorithm

The image enhancement algorithm needs to compute an integer value for every
location of the input image. The integer value is made of 9 bits, whose
value is taken from the state of the 9 pixels around the location (a lit
pixel means `1`, and a dark pixel means `0`).

That 9-bit integer value is then used as an index in the enhancement
algorithm string to find the state of the output pixel at that location.

We implement the algorithm as a method of the class `Enhancer`:

~~~ scala

class Enhancer(enhancementString: IndexedSeq[Pixel]):

  def enhance(image: Image): Image =
    val pixels =
      for y <- -1 until (image.height + 1)
      yield
        for x <- -1 until (image.width + 1)
        yield enhancementString(locationValue(image, x, y))

    val outOfBoundsPixel =
      val value = if image.outOfBoundsPixel == Pixel.Dark then 0 else 511
      enhancementString(value)

    Image(pixels, outOfBoundsPixel)
  end enhance

end Enhancer
~~~

Since we look at the 9 pixels around every location, we look at locations
outside the image rectangle where some of these 9 pixels overlap with the
rectangle (hence the bounds `-1` and `height + 1` for the `y` coordinates).

The 9-bit integer value of each location is computed by an auxiliary method,
`locationValue`, which is shown below.

Last, we also compute the “enhancement” of the pixels that are out of the
bounds of the image rectangle. Since these pixels are all the same, the 9
pixels around any location out of the bounds of the rectangle will always be
either all lit or all dark. The binary value corresponding to all pixels
dark is `000000000`, which equals `0`, and the binary value corresponding to
all pixels lit is `111111111`, which equals `511`.

Here is the implementation of the auxiliary method `locationValue`:

~~~ scala
def locationValue(image: Image, x: Int, y: Int): Int =
  var result = 0
  for
    yy <- (y - 1) to (y + 1)
    xx <- (x - 1) to (x + 1)
  do
    result = result << 1
    if image.pixel(xx, yy) == Pixel.Lit then
      result = result | 1
    end if
  end for
  result
end locationValue
~~~

We read the 9 pixels around the provided location, starting from the
top-left corner, and going to the right. If a pixel is lit, we interpret it
as a `1`. At every iteration, we shift the previously computed result one
bit to the left before reading the new bit.

To read the pixel value in the image, we use a handy method `pixel`, defined
in the class `Image`:

~~~ scala
def pixel(x: Int, y: Int): Pixel =
  if y < 0 || y >= height then outOfBoundsPixel
  else if x < 0 || x >= width then outOfBoundsPixel
  else pixels(y)(x)
~~~

This method implements the fact that the image has an infinite size. It
checks the bounds of the location to access, and when the location is out of
the bounds of the rectangle image, it returns the `outOfBoundsPixel` color
of the image.

## Solution of part 1

We were asked to apply two times in a row the enhancement algorithm on the
input image, and to compute the number of lit pixels in the output image:

~~~ scala
def part1(input: String): Int =
  val (enhancer, image0) = parseEnhancerAndImage(input)
  val image1 = enhancer.enhance(image0)
  val image2 = enhancer.enhance(image1)
  image2.countLitPixels()
~~~

The method `countLitPixels` is defined as follows in the class `Image`:

~~~ scala
class Image(pixels: IndexedSeq[IndexedSeq[Pixel]], outOfBoundsPixel: Pixel):
  def countLitPixels(): Int =
    pixels.view.flatten.count(_ == Pixel.Lit)
~~~

We flatten the rows of pixels into a single collection of pixels, and we
count the lit pixels on it. The call to `view` before `flatten` allows us to
traverse the rows of pixels without constructing the flattened collection.

## Full code for part 1

~~~ scala
def part1(input: String): Int =
  val (enhancer, image0) = parseEnhancerAndImage(input)
  val image1 = enhancer.enhance(image0)
  val image2 = enhancer.enhance(image1)
  image2.countLitPixels()

def parseEnhancerAndImage(input: String): (Enhancer, Image) =
  val enhancerAndImage = input.split("\n\n")
  val enhancer         = Enhancer.parse(enhancerAndImage(0))
  val image            = Image.parse(enhancerAndImage(1))
  (enhancer, image)

enum Pixel:
  case Lit, Dark

object Pixel:

  def parse(char: Char): Pixel =
    char match
      case '#' => Pixel.Lit
      case '.' => Pixel.Dark

end Pixel

object Enhancer:

  def parse(input: String): Enhancer =
    Enhancer(input.map(Pixel.parse))

end Enhancer

class Enhancer(enhancementString: IndexedSeq[Pixel]):

  def enhance(image: Image): Image =
    val pixels =
      for y <- -1 until (image.height + 1)
      yield
        for x <- -1 until (image.width + 1)
        yield enhancementString(locationValue(image, x, y))

    val outOfBoundsPixel =
      val value = if image.outOfBoundsPixel == Pixel.Dark then 0 else 511
      enhancementString(value)

    Image(pixels, outOfBoundsPixel)
  end enhance

  private def locationValue(image: Image, x: Int, y: Int): Int =
    var result = 0
    for
      yy <- (y - 1) to (y + 1)
      xx <- (x - 1) to (x + 1)
    do
      result = result << 1
      if image.pixel(xx, yy) == Pixel.Lit then
        result = result | 1
      end if
    end for
    result
  end locationValue

end Enhancer

class Image(pixels: IndexedSeq[IndexedSeq[Pixel]], val outOfBoundsPixel: Pixel):

  require(pixels.map(_.length).distinct.size == 1, "All the rows must have the same length")

  val height = pixels.length
  val width  = pixels(0).length

  def pixel(x: Int, y: Int): Pixel =
    if y < 0 || y >= height then outOfBoundsPixel
    else if x < 0 || x >= width then outOfBoundsPixel
    else pixels(y)(x)

  def countLitPixels(): Int =
    pixels.view.flatten.count(_ == Pixel.Lit)

end Image

object Image:
  def parse(input: String): Image =
    val pixels =
      input
        .linesIterator.map(line => line.map(Pixel.parse))
        .toIndexedSeq
    val outOfBoundsPixel = Pixel.Dark
    Image(pixels, outOfBoundsPixel)
~~~

## Solution for part 2

In part 2, we had to apply the “enhancement algorithm” 50 times instead
of just twice:

~~~ scala
def part2(input: String): Int =
  val (enhancer, image) = parseEnhancerAndImage(input)
  LazyList
    .iterate(image)(enhancer.enhance)
    .apply(50)
    .countLitPixels()
~~~

We parse the input with the same method as in part1, `parseEnhancerAndImage`.

To apply the enhancer 50 times, we use a `LazyList`. First, we create an
_infinite_ lazy list whose first element is the parsed input `image`, and
whose `n + 1` element is computed by calling `enhancer.enhance` on the
element `n`. Then, we compute its 50th element by calling `.apply(50)`. As a
consequence, only the first 50 elements will be computed at all.

Finally, we call `countLitPixels()` on the output image to count its number
of lit pixels.
